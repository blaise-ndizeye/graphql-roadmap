# GraphQL Fullstack Developer Roadmap

**Early Draft, WIP**

### Resources

I suggest you to avoid GraphQL tutorials that rely on Prisma/Hasura/Postgraphile/Autho0 and other proprietary stacks. 
Learn "low-level" basics first and consider the following:

1. You can't be sure these solutions will exist 1-2 years ahead. 
2. Most of them change APIs and even their essence frequently.  

#### Recommended

* [GraphQL by example](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-by-example/) (Udemy) (server)<br>
A rare exception of a good cource at Udemy. Complexity and speed are perfectly up to the point. 
* [Introduction to GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/graphql/) (FrontendMasters) (server)<br>
Good course on the basics. Scott Moss is a talented narrator. 
* [Advanced GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-graphql/) (FrontendMasters) (server)<br>
TODO: Didn't watch yet. Looks good though :)
* [Apollo Client with React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-1-apollo-client-with-react) (LevelUp) (client)<br>
Good intro to Apollo Client.

#### Not Recommended

* [~GraphQL: Scalable APIs~](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/graphql-scalable-apis) (PluralSight) (server)<br>
Not bad but outdated. The sequence of topics could be better.
* [~Modern GraphQL bootcamp~](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-bootcamp/) (Udemy) (fullstack)<br>
Good beginning, then switches to Prisma and things get messy.
* [~Advanced React and GraphQL~](https://advancedreact.com/) (Wes Bos) (fullstack)<br>
Relies on Prisma. Attempts to teach you Markup & CSS, React, and GraphQL in parallel.
* [~GraphQL with React~](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-with-react-course/) (Udemy) (fullstack)<br>
It's not bad but way too slow and bloated for my taste. 
* [~How to GraphQL~](https://www.howtographql.com) (HowToGraphQL.com) (fullstack)<br>
Sneakingly inserts Prisma into the narrative.
