# GraphQL Fullstack Developer Roadmap

**WIP**

### Resources

I suggest you to avoid GraphQL tutorials that rely on Prisma/Hasura/Postgraphile/Autho0 and other proprietary stacks. 

1. *High-level* GraphQL tools of today won't probably exist 1-2 years ahead. 
2. At least not in their current form.
3. They're hightly unstable: APIs & concepts change rapidly.

GraphQL on itself hovewer (being a language) changes slow and gracefully. So learn fundamentals first 
and consider those code generators after you get some real-world experience with GraphQL. 

#### Recommended

* [GraphQL for absolute beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyvsMKsEsyE&list=PLN3n1USn4xln0j_NN9k4j5hS1thsGibKi) (YouTube) (basics)<br>
For absolute beginners. Great introductory series.
* [GraphQL by example](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-by-example/) (Udemy) (fullstack)<br>
A rare exception of a good cource at Udemy. Depth and pacing are up to the point. 
* [Introduction to GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/graphql/) (FrontendMasters) (server)<br>
A good course on the basics. 
* [Advanced GraphQL](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-graphql/) (FrontendMasters) (server)<br>
Despite the name, it's quite basic. Watch it right after the previous one.
* [Apollo Client with React](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/level-1-apollo-client-with-react) (LevelUp) (client)<br>
A good intro to Apollo Client.

#### Not Recommended

* [~GraphQL: Scalable APIs~](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/graphql-scalable-apis) (PluralSight) (server)<br>
Not bad but outdated. The sequence of topics could be better.
* [~Modern GraphQL bootcamp~](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-bootcamp/) (Udemy) (fullstack)<br>
Good beginning, then switches to Prisma and things get messy.
* [~Advanced React and GraphQL~](https://advancedreact.com/) (Wes Bos) (fullstack)<br>
Relies on Prisma. Attempts to teach you Markup & CSS, React, and GraphQL in parallel.
* [~GraphQL with React~](https://www.udemy.com/graphql-with-react-course/) (Udemy) (fullstack)<br>
It's not bad but way too slow and bloated for my taste. 
* [~How to GraphQL~](https://www.howtographql.com) (HowToGraphQL.com) (fullstack)<br>
Sneakingly inserts Prisma into the narrative.
* [~Designing GraphQL schemas~](https://egghead.io/courses/designing-graphql-schemas) (Egghead.com) (fullstack)<br>
Had many unfullfilled hopes for this course. It consists of 50% trivias and 50% highly debatable advices.
